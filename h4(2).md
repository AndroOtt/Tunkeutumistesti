6.1
  Most system store credentials in some sort of database, in websites sql database, active directory they store them in a proprietary database. 
  External blue exploit, they used a tool called Mimikatz they dumped the passwords out of memory, passwords have to be protected in 2 ways, over the network and in the storage. 
6.2 
  Most people reuse passwords
Admin password is good to get
Search for default passwords like "admin" "123456" "  "qwerty789" "Elokuu20XX"
  How to obtain certain passwords?
   Capturing credentials over the network
  MITM attacks againts clear text protocols (pretty obsolete nowadays)
  MITM attacks againts ciphered protocols (Spoof an SSL certificate, SSH downgrade attacks)
  MITM relay attacks (steal the creds directly from the device)
  Brute forcing passwords (Medusa,Dirbuster, etc)
  First you have to find the users to crack the passwords.
  Nmap has scripts to enumarate users
6.4 
  Password storage vulnerability 
  Dictionaries like rainbow tables to crack passwords
  Windows does not have salting in their password
  Because people use re-use passwords, you can use password breaches to guess their passwords.
6.5
  John the ripper demo
  You can use a dictionary here, you can add rules to your dictionaries
  Different types of formats, depening on the hash type you want to crack
  In the demo they were cracking older windows hashes, cracking split passwords, microsoft algorithm used to split the password hashes into 2.
  Like most tools John has a dictionary attack mode aswell. 
  
How to improve password security?
  - 2 factor authentication
  - certificate based authentication
  - hash salting
  - better randomness and longer passwords
