6.1
  Most system store credentials in some sort of database, in websites sql database, active directory they store them in a proprietary database. 
  External blue exploit, they used a tool called Mimikatz they dumped the passwords out of memory, passwords have to be protected in 2 ways, over the network and in the storage. 
6.2 
  Most people reuse passwords
Admin password is good to get
Search for default passwords like "admin" "123456" "  "qwerty789" "Elokuu20XX"
  How to obtain certain passwords?
   Capturing credentials over the network
  MITM attacks againts clear text protocols (pretty obsolete nowadays)
  MITM attacks againts ciphered protocols (Spoof an SSL certificate, SSH downgrade attacks)
  MITM relay attacks (steal the creds directly from the device)
  Brute forcing passwords (Medusa,Dirbuster, etc)
  First you have to find the users to crack the passwords.
  Nmap has scripts to enumarate users
6.4 
  Password storage vulnerability 
  Dictionaries like rainbow tables to crack passwords
  Windows does not have salting in their password
  Because people use re-use passwords, you can use password breaches to guess their passwords.
6.5
  John the ripper demo
  You can use a dictionary here, you can add rules to your dictionaries
  Different types of formats, depening on the hash type you want to crack
  In the demo they were cracking older windows hashes, cracking split passwords, microsoft algorithm used to split the password hashes into 2.
  Like most tools John has a dictionary attack mode aswell. 
  
How to improve password security?
  - 2 factor authentication
  - certificate based authentication
  - hash salting
  - better randomness and longer passwords

Jotta John the Ripper työkalua voi käyttää, pitää olla muutama kirjasto asennettuna.

  ---*Kirjastot*---
  
  Micro =
  
  Bash-completion =
  
  git =
  
  build-essential =
  
  libssl-dev = 
  
  zlib1g =
  
  libbz2.1.9 =
  
  atool zip =
  
  wget =
  
Then more information on how to download and install the password cracker, trough a git clone approach.

The article then goes into detail on how to crack a zip file that is protected with a password

In the end there are a bunch of formats that john the ripper can crack, such as monero, tezos, telegram and more.

X3) In the article, it is outlined that hashcat needs to know the type of hash to crack. You can identify what hash to crack by using the -m command, which will

The article goes into detail how to use hashcat, aswell as how to print the output that hashcat generates.

Then some common error messages and what they mean, for example. exhausted means that you used all the passwords on the list, and there are no more passwords to try againts the hash.

You can also make hashcat work faster by hosting it on real hardware instead of a virtualbox.
